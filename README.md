# State Machines
Playing about with finite state machines and Haskell as part of a Coursera/EIT series on automata verification. The plan is to implement the course material in Haskell (it uses mCLR2 in the course). Issue is there aren't many docs online about different types of bisimilarity/tracing, such as strong/weak or rooted simlarities, so anything useful that I do find will go below.
